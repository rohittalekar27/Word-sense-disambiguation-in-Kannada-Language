This project focuses on building a machine learning model (or natural language processing model) to work with a specific dataset. However, due to limited availability or the small size of the dataset, there are certain limitations that affect the model's performance and generalizability.
Data Augmentation:
To mitigate the problem of a small dataset, techniques such as data augmentation (creating synthetic variations of the existing data) can be applied to increase the dataset size.

Pretrained Models:
Utilizing pre-trained models like BERT, Word2Vec, or other NLP models can help overcome the limitation of small datasets. These models are trained on large corpora and can generalize better even with limited domain-specific data.

Transfer Learning:
Transfer learning allows us to use a pre-trained model and fine-tune it on our smaller dataset. This helps to improve the model's performance by leveraging knowledge from larger datasets.

Future Scope:
If more data becomes available in the future, this model can be retrained to improve its accuracy and effectiveness. Contributions from the community in terms of data collection or additional features are welcome.
